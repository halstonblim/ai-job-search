=====Job Result 1=====
url:            https://www.samsara.com/company/careers/roles/6774592?gh_jid=6774592
title:          Software Engineer - GenAI at Samsara
fit_score:      5
reason:
    The candidate is an excellent fit for the Full Stack Software Engineer role at
    Samsara. The resume demonstrates 7 years of full-stack experience (well above
    the 1-3 years required), including hands-on work with Go, TypeScript, React, and
    AWS—all technologies mentioned in the job description. The candidate has
    experience delivering production-scale features, working cross-functionally, and
    supporting operational systems, all of which align with core responsibilities in
    the role. The employer seeks engineers with a growth mindset and strong
    communication skills, which the candidate demonstrates through mentorship,
    promoting best practices, and continual skill development. Although the
    candidate prefers back-end roles and Python, they have strong full-stack and Go
    experience, which is central to Samsara's stack. The candidate’s experience with
    IoT, real-time systems, and AWS also matches the job’s industry and technical
    focus. Overall, this candidate clearly exceeds the requirements and closely
    aligns with the role's needs.

=====Job Result 2=====
url:            http://job-boards.greenhouse.io/appliedintuition/jobs/4420849005?gh_jid=4420849005
title:          Software Engineer - New Grad at Applied Intuition
fit_score:      5
reason:
    The candidate is an excellent fit for the Software Engineer position at Applied
    Intuition. Their resume demonstrates 7 years of strong full-stack and backend
    engineering experience with an emphasis on Python and relevant frameworks
    (Django REST, FastAPI, React, Docker, Kubernetes). The candidate has experience
    with most of the 'nice to have' technologies in the job description (React,
    Docker, Kubernetes, containerization, API layers, and database ORM). While
    direct robotics or simulation/ROS tooling isn't explicitly listed, the overall
    background in handling complex systems, quick adoption of new tech, and
    experience in fast-paced environments aligns closely with the requirements.
    Preference for backend roles and Python also matches the stack highlighted. The
    only minor gap is robotics-specific middleware, but the strong base and
    adaptability compensate for this. Overall, this is a 5/5 fit.
failed:         False

=====Job Result 3=====
url:            https://www.grammarly.com/careers/jobs/engineering/software-engineer-back-end?gh_jid=5856122
title:          Software Engineer, Back-End at Grammarly
fit_score:      4
reason:
    The candidate has 7 years of experience in full-stack/back-end development with
    significant focus on backend, including leading backend architecture at scale,
    working extensively with AWS, Terraform, and production systems. They have
    strong experience with cloud infrastructure, microservices, and mentoring, which
    align closely with the job requirements. The candidate prefers Python, while the
    job is Java/JVM-oriented—however, the resume demonstrates an ability to learn
    new technologies (e.g., Go, Kubernetes, Rust), suggesting adaptability. The
    candidate’s leadership, mentoring experience, and alignment with engineering
    culture are a strong fit, but lack of direct Java/JVM experience prevents a
    perfect score.
failed:         False
error_message:
    

=====Job Result 4=====
url:            https://www.brex.com/careers/7985666002?gh_jid=7985666002
title:          Software Engineer, Intern at Brex
fit_score:      4
reason:
    The candidate is a highly experienced full-stack software engineer with 7 years
    of hands-on development, significant backend expertise (Python, Go), and a
    strong foundation in cloud infrastructure, databases, and modern software
    practices. They possess experience with relevant backend languages (Python,
    SQL), cloud technologies (AWS), and a demonstrated ability to work in fast-
    paced, high-impact teams, which aligns well with Brex’s requirements. While the
    candidate exceeds the experience level typically required for an internship (and
    may be overqualified compared to new grads), their profile is a very strong fit
    for the technical and collaborative requirements. There is no explicit mention
    of prior AI tooling expertise, which is a bonus but not required. The
    candidate's preference for backend and Python roles also strongly matches the
    stated tech stack and project focus. Missing factors are possible lack of direct
    recent AI work and the overqualification for an internship, which keeps this
    from being a perfect 5-fit.
failed:         False

=====Job Result 5=====
url:            https://www.grammarly.com/careers/jobs/engineering/software-engineer-full-stack?gh_jid=6356355
title:          Software Engineer, Full-Stack at Grammarly
fit_score:      4
reason:
    The candidate is a very strong fit for Grammarly's Full-Stack Software Engineer
    role: 7 years of relevant full-stack experience, leadership in back-end
    platforms, IaC expertise (Terraform), and mentorship align well with Grammarly's
    requirements. Technical skills in Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, React, AWS,
    Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and microservices are highly relevant. The only
    partial gap is the stated user preference for primarily backend roles and
    Python, while this job entails equal focus on both frontend (React, etc.) and
    backend, and likely requires flexibility in tech stack beyond Python. Overall,
    the alignment is strong enough for a 4/5 fit.
failed:         False
error_message:
    

=====Job Result 6=====
url:            https://camunda.com/jobs/?gh_jid=6496723003&utm_source=EU_Remote_Jobs
title:          Software Engineer, Full Stack - Core Features at Camunda
fit_score:      3
reason:
    The candidate is a skilled full-stack engineer with 7 years of experience and
    deep React expertise, meeting the requirement for React frontend development.
    While the candidate has significant backend proficiency, especially with Python,
    Go, and cloud skills (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes), the Camunda role specifically
    requires 4+ years of Java (Spring Boot, JUnit, REST APIs) experience, which does
    not appear on the resume. The candidate prefers backend work and Python; this
    job is balanced (full-stack, including significant frontend work) and is
    centered on Java for backend tasks. There is a strong skill overlap in
    DevOps/cloud, web application architecture, and team collaboration. Fit is
    moderate—excellent on frontend and DevOps, but missing key backend language
    (Java) and preferred technology alignment (Python).
failed:         False

=====Job Result 7=====
url:            https://www.williamblair.com/careers/job-description?gh_jid=4655099007
title:          Senior Software Development Analyst at William Blair
fit_score:      2
reason:
    The candidate is a skilled software engineer with 7 years of experience, strong
    Python and SQL skills, and experience leading projects and working in the cloud.
    However, the job requires hands-on expertise (at least 3 years) specifically
    with Azure Synapse, ADF, Databricks, and related Azure tools, none of which
    appear in the resume. The candidate is instead specialized in AWS and
    technologies like Terraform, GitHub Actions, and PostgreSQL/Snowflake. There is
    no evidence of experience in Azure's data ecosystem, ADF/Synapse, or familiarity
    with Microsoft-centric tools (Power Apps, Logic Apps, Key Vault, Azure DevOps).
    Overall, while technically strong, there is a substantial gap in platform-
    specific experience needed for this role. The candidate also prefers backend
    Python roles, which is a limited but only partial fit for this position.
failed:         False
error_message:
    

=====Job Result 8=====
url:            https://www.cannondesign.com/careers/director-of-software-engineering-fos?gh_jid=7993242002
title:          Director of Software Engineering - FOS at Facility Optimization Solutions, LLC (FOS), a subsidiary of CannonDesign
fit_score:      2
reason:
    The candidate has 7 years of experience (versus 12+ required) and no direct
    management or director-level background, though they mentor junior engineers.
    Technically, the candidate shows strong full-stack and cloud skills, extensive
    microservices, CI/CD, DevOps, cloud experience (albeit in AWS, not Azure), and
    Agile/Scrum. However, the role demands leadership, architectural strategy, and
    organizational influence at a director level—areas not demonstrated in the
    resume. Additionally, the candidate prefers backend work and Python, while this
    role is broader and less hands-on. There is a technical skill match but the
    experience and leadership gap is significant. Thus, fit is poor to fair (2/5).
