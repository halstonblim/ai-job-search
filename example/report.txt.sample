=====Job Result 1=====
url:            http://job-boards.greenhouse.io/appliedintuition/jobs/4420849005?gh_jid=4420849005
title:          Software Engineer - New Grad at Applied Intuition
fit_score:      5
reason:
    The candidate is a senior full-stack software engineer with 7 years of
    experience, including deep expertise in Python, React, Kubernetes, Docker, and
    cloud infrastructure—all highly relevant to the job's requirements in
    infrastructure, full-stack, and autonomy development. Their resume demonstrates
    initiatives, problem-solving, and cross-domain collaboration, aligning very well
    with the role's responsibilities. Technical skills match the 'nice to have' list
    (React, Kubernetes, Docker), and the required experience level is exceeded. The
    only minor misalignment is a stated preference for backend, while this role is
    broad/full-stack, but the candidate's breadth makes them highly adaptable.
    Strong fit overall.

=====Job Result 2=====
url:            https://www.samsara.com/company/careers/roles/6774592?gh_jid=6774592
title:          Software Engineer - GenAI at Samsara
fit_score:      5
reason:
    The candidate is an excellent fit for this role. Their 7 years of full-stack
    software engineering experience exceeds the required 1-3 years. They have strong
    backend and frontend exposure (Go, TypeScript, React, AWS), having shipped
    customer-facing features and operated systems at scale. The candidate
    specifically has Go, TypeScript, React, SQL, and extensive AWS experience, which
    matches the stack mentioned in the job posting. They have demonstrated
    ownership, system architecture, and operational engineering. While their resume
    does not specifically mention LLM experience, all other technical and role
    requirements are fully met, and the candidate brings even broader knowledge and
    leadership experience than the role requires. Their preference for backend
    aligns with the job's flexibility. This is a remote role and fits location
    needs. Overall, this is an outstanding fit.
failed:         False

=====Job Result 3=====
url:            https://www.grammarly.com/careers/jobs/engineering/software-engineer-back-end?gh_jid=5856122
title:          Software Engineer, Back-End at Grammarly
fit_score:      4
reason:
    The candidate is a strong match for Grammarly's Back-End Software Engineer role.
    They have 7 years of software engineering experience, well above the 3+ year
    minimum, and significant backend expertise. Their resume shows extensive AWS
    (used in production, with IaC via Terraform), large-scale system deployment, and
    mentoring experience, all highlighted in the job description. The candidate has
    not specifically worked with Java or JVM languages (preferred by Grammarly),
    instead focusing on Python, Go, and TypeScript, which is the main gap. However,
    their strong software engineering fundamentals and cloud experience offset this.
    The candidate prefers Python (not Java), which is a minor mismatch, but the rest
    of their preferences and profile align well with the job. Thus, this is a very
    good (not perfect) fit, rated 4 out of 5.
failed:         False

=====Job Result 4=====
url:            https://camunda.com/jobs/?gh_jid=6496723003&utm_source=EU_Remote_Jobs
title:          Software Engineer, Full Stack - Core Features at Camunda
fit_score:      4
reason:
    The candidate has extensive full stack experience (7 years), strong React
    skills, and significant backend experience with modern technologies and cloud
    infrastructure. However, the job requires deep Java (Spring Boot) experience,
    which the resume does not emphasize; the candidate prefers Python for backend,
    and their Java expertise isn't evident. Otherwise, the experience with React,
    microservices, cloud (though on AWS, not GCP), and full-stack ownership make the
    candidate a strong match. This is not a perfect alignment due to the Java-
    specific backend requirement but the overall profile is quite close to what the
    job seeks.
failed:         False
error_message:
    

=====Job Result 5=====
url:            https://www.avepoint.com/careers/job-detail?gh_jid=6767508
title:          Software Engineer at AvePoint
fit_score:      3
reason:
    The candidate exceeds the required experience (7 years vs. 3+) and has strong
    full-stack skills, especially with React and modern JavaScript frameworks,
    aligning well with the frontend tech (React, JavaScript) in the job description.
    However, there is no explicit .NET (C#) or Java backend experience, which is a
    key requirement for this job. Their backend expertise is in Python, Go, and
    cloud is with AWS rather than Azure. The fit is good for full-stack and
    frontend, but lacking in preferred backend stack (.NET/Java) and cloud (Azure).
failed:         False
error_message:
    

=====Job Result 6=====
url:            https://careers.airbnb.com/positions/6887823/?gh_jid=6887823
title:          Staff Software Engineer, Marketplace Operations at Airbnb
fit_score:      3
reason:
    The candidate is an experienced backend engineer with 7 years of professional
    experience, strong cloud infrastructure skills, and leadership/mentorship in
    fast-scaling environments. However, the Airbnb role requires over 9 years of
    industry experience and proficiency specifically in backend languages such as
    Java or C++, which do not appear on the candidate’s resume (the resume lists
    Python, Go, and TypeScript as main languages). While the candidate demonstrates
    strong distributed systems and API experience, they fall short on both years of
    experience and technology match. The role and the candidate's preferences both
    align strongly for seniority and backend work, but there are two notable gaps
    (years and required language). This makes for a moderate (3/5) fit.
failed:         False
error_message:
    

=====Job Result 7=====
url:            https://camunda.com/jobs/?gh_jid=6243031003
title:          Senior Software Engineer, Backend - AI at Camunda
fit_score:      2
reason:
    The candidate does not have significant Java experience (the job requires 5+
    years), nor explicit LLM API experience. The candidate is a strong backend/full-
    stack engineer with Python, Go, and TypeScript but lacks Java on their resume
    and prefers Python. Additionally, LLM/AI platform work is not highlighted in
    their experience. The candidate meets the general experience level and back-end
    focus preference, but tech stack mismatch makes fit low.
failed:         False
error_message:
    

=====Job Result 8=====
url:            https://www.williamblair.com/careers/job-description?gh_jid=4655099007
title:          Senior Software Development Analyst at William Blair
fit_score:      2
reason:
    The applicant has over 6 years of software engineering experience and a strong
    backend background with proficiency in Python and SQL, aligning with some core
    requirements. However, this job requires extensive, hands-on experience (at
    least 3 years) specifically with Azure Synapse, Azure Data Factory, ADLS, Spark,
    Databricks, and other Azure tooling, which is not demonstrated in the
    resume—instead, the candidate's cloud experience is with AWS and other tools.
    There is also no evidence of experience with Azure DevOps, YML scripting for
    Azure, Logic Apps, or financial services, nor knowledge in the preferred skills
    like O365 SharePoint, Power Apps, or Microsoft Fabric. Thus, there are
    significant skill and tooling mismatches, making this a poor fit for the role.
failed:         False

=====Job Result 9=====
url:            https://www.jumptrading.com/careers/6885296/?gh_jid=6885296
title:          Campus Software Engineer (Intern) at Jump Trading Group
fit_score:      2
reason:
    The candidate is a highly experienced full-stack/backend engineer with 7 years
    of experience, strong skills in Python, Go, cloud infrastructure, and
    distributed systems. However, the Jump Trading role is a 10-week internship
    targeting students or very early-career candidates, with a strong preference for
    C++ on Linux and intended for those seeking their first full-time opportunity
    after graduation. The candidate's experience far exceeds internship
    requirements, does not show C++ expertise, and their stated preferences are for
    mid-to-senior backend roles (not internships or new grad positions). This is
    therefore a poor fit.
failed:         False
error_message:
    

=====Job Result 10=====
url:            https://www.brex.com/careers/7985666002?gh_jid=7985666002
title:          Software Engineer, Intern at Brex
fit_score:      1
reason:
    The job is an internship role intended for students, requiring availability in
    late 2025 and likely pursuing a degree. The resume is for a highly experienced
    engineer (7 years experience, prior senior roles). The candidate prefers backend
    roles with a minimum of 3 years experience and explicitly indicates no interest
    in new grad or intern positions. There is a clear mismatch between the seniority
    and experience of the candidate and the entry-level nature of the job.
failed:         False
error_message:
    

=====Job Result 11=====
url:            https://www.payoneer.com/careers/position/6585884/?gh_jid=6585884
title:          Software Engineer Intern at Payoneer
fit_score:      1
reason:
    The job is an internship role in Gurugram, India, while the candidate has 7
    years of professional experience and is looking for backend engineering roles
    requiring at least 3 years of experience. The candidate explicitly does not want
    jobs intended for new graduates or interns. This is a poor fit.
failed:         False
error_message:
    

=====Job Result 12=====
url:            https://www.cambridgeconsultants.com/jobs/cambridgeconsultantslimited/2025-graduate-software-engineer/?gh_jid=4418085101
title:          2025 Graduate Software Engineer at Cambridge Consultants
fit_score:      1
reason:
    The candidate has 7 years of experience and prefers backend roles using Python,
    seeking positions that require at least 3 years of experience. The Cambridge
    Consultants Graduate Software Engineer role is specifically targeted at fresh
    graduates, making this a very poor fit for the candidate's experience and
    preferences.
