=====Job Result 3=====
url:            https://mark43.com/list-job/software-engineer/?gh_jid=6721336
title:          Software Engineer at Mark43
fit_score:      4
reason:
    The candidate has 7 years of full-stack software engineering experience with
    strong backend skills using Go, Python, and JavaScript, and  experience with
    React on the frontend, matching the job's requirement for Java and React
    expertise. They have deep cloud infrastructure skills with AWS, microservices
    architecture experience, and familiarity with databases including Redis and
    Elasticsearch, all aligning well with the job's technical stack. They have
    strong Agile and automated testing experience which meets job requirements. The
    candidate also demonstrates leadership and mentoring qualities valued in the
    preferred traits. However, the candidate's resume does not explicitly state Java
    experience although they have similar language experience and the role
    emphasizes Java production experience, which is a slight area of mismatch.
    Overall, the candidate is a strong fit for this remote full-time software
    engineer role focusing on cloud-based public safety software.

=====Job Result 4=====
url:            https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/appliedintuition/jobs/4420849005?gh_jid=4420849005
title:          Software Engineer - New Grad at Applied Intuition
fit_score:      4
reason:
    The candidate is a senior full-stack software engineer with 7 years of
    experience and strong skills in backend technologies including Python, Go, SQL,
    and cloud infrastructure such as AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes. This aligns well
    with the job's requirements for designing engineering solutions in a fast-paced
    environment and working across full-stack and infrastructure challenges. The
    candidate also has experience with React and Docker, which matches the job's
    desirable skills. Although the candidate prefers remote and backend roles, the
    job is primarily onsite in Mountain View with some flexibility for remote work.
    Overall, the candidate's experience and skills make them a strong fit for this
    role, though not a perfect match due to location preference and some full-stack
    emphasis in the job description.

=====Job Result 5=====
url:            https://www.grammarly.com/careers/jobs/engineering/software-engineer-back-end?gh_jid=5856122
title:          Software Engineer, Back-End at Grammarly
fit_score:      4
reason:
    The candidate has 7 years of software engineering experience with strong backend
    development skills and technical expertise including AWS, Terraform IaC, and
    microservice architectures, matching well with the job requirements. The
    candidate uses cloud services and infrastructure as code, aligns with agile
    practices, and mentors others, which fits Grammarly's qualifications well. The
    preference for backend roles aligns with the job as a Back-End Software
    Engineer. However, the candidate primarily codes in Go, Python, and TypeScript
    rather than Java or JVM languages as GRM requires, which is a minor mismatch.
    The job is hybrid in San Francisco, while the candidate prefers remote, which
    may be a location preference gap. Overall, this is a strong fit but not perfect
    due to language and location preference differences.

=====Job Result 6=====
url:            https://jobs.cisco.com/jobs/ProjectDetail/Lead-ML-Engineer-Meraki-Assurance-Remote-U-S-Canada/1439847
title:          Lead ML Engineer, Meraki Assurance, Remote U.S./Canada at Cisco Meraki
fit_score:      3
reason:
    The candidate has 7 years of software engineering experience with strong skills
    in Python, AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, and data engineering, which are
    relevant to the Lead Machine Learning Engineer role at Cisco Meraki. However,
    the role requires 12+ years of experience specifically in ML, data engineering,
    or related fields, along with expertise in building large-scale AI models, deep
    learning frameworks, and MLOps practices, which are not clearly demonstrated in
    the candidate's resume. The candidate shows some exposure to relevant
    technologies and machine learning coursework but lacks extensive direct
    experience in ML engineering leadership and deep learning frameworks like
    TensorFlow or PyTorch. The candidate prefers remote backend roles, aligning with
    the position's remote nature and backend-focused ML engineering
    responsibilities. Overall, the fit is decent but not strong due to gaps in
    direct ML leadership and advanced ML skill requirements.

=====Job Result 7=====
url:            https://careers.gofasti.com/job-application/5553072004?gh_jid=5553072004
title:          Junior Software Engineer at GoFasti
fit_score:      3
reason:
    The candidate is a highly experienced full-stack engineer with 7 years of
    experience and strong skills in backend and cloud technologies, including AWS,
    PostgreSQL, and Node.js, which align well with many of the job requirements.
    However, the candidate's expertise is primarily in Python, Go, and modern cloud
    infrastructure and microservices, while the job requires 1â€“2 years of experience
    specifically with legacy PHP, NestJS, NextJS, and LAMP stack technologies. The
    candidate's seniority level is much higher than the junior-level role described,
    which might affect role fit. The candidate prefers remote and backend roles,
    which matches the job's remote-first environment and backend focus. Overall,
    this is a moderate fit because the candidate has related experience and skills
    but not the specific legacy PHP and junior-level experience the job requires.
